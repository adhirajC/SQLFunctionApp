2.2)I have attached the 2.1 of this section to a rar called 2.1.rar, it contains all the pictures of the gui. The gui has search options for brown rice exclusively and departments exlusively. However, I have also added a search option that searches brown rices available in a certain department store after that department store has been selected. I have done so because it would be redundant to put in another range of search functions in the department store searcher. The original search brown rice function covers all the necessary search options needed for brown rice. All of the integer parameters with the exception of id and score have a max and min input parameter. This is created so it gives the customer an option to choose the price range in which they want to shop and the size range. I have set up score to have a minimum input only because a customer will try to get a food item that has the best score possible and will not be looking for low scoring food items.
